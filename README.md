Utilities for simple modelling of absorption cycle heat pumps

Absorption chillers and heat pumps are fun to model! Here we follow along
with the popular textbook by Herold, Radermacher, and Klein and show how
to implement examples and exercises using open software, namely Python.

Other open approaches may be available. Also, commercial solvers may
be what you need. There are many; some are documented in the excellent
dissertation by Osman Ayadi, PhD, from University of Milano.

Feel free to get in touch and/or help me. At the moment I need to finish
implementing the ammonia-water mixture properties. I will be using the IAPWS
guidelines, which follow on the older (and I notice, slightly different)
paper by Tillner-Roth and Friend.
